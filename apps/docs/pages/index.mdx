# JacobHQ Core
JacobHQ Core is a series of utilities for composing websites built on top of Chakra UI. It's been battle tested, and used on most of the sites under the JacobHQ brand.

### Folder structure
I use Turborepo to structure this monorepo.
- `apps/docs` - These docs, which are built with Nextra
- `packages/ui` - UI components, like headers and footers

### First steps
To use JacobHQ Core in your project, install the npm package `jhq-ui`. You can now import components, and use them in your react code.
