# Playground
This is a playground, where you can try out any of the JacobHQ UI components, and, if needed, open them in Codesandbox to continue your work. To use authentication, please login [here](/api/auth/login), not in the demo.

<Play imports={['Layout']} content={`<Layout appTitle="Demo" description="This is a demo of the Layout component."></Layout>`} />

The integration with Auth0 won't work in these demos.
